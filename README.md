Umbrel


## Overview and Origin

Desiring privacy is not morally wrong or illegal. It is a tenet of a free society. 

Bill of Rights of the United States of America states the following:

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

Is storing all of your financial and personal information on the “cloud” (ie someone else’s computer) a good idea? What is the alternative? 

Umbrel thinks they have one: personal servers owned by regular people in their own homes.

Incorporated in 2020 by founders Luke Childs and Mayank Chhabra, Umbrel was born from the idea of using a Raspberry Pi as a personal web server. 

In 2019, Chhabra was running a Bitcoin node on a Raspberry Pi computer and wanted to get off the cloud, and onto self-owned dedicated hardware. Once he figured it out, he wanted to de-cloud more and run everything on his node, owning all of his data locally and reducing his reliance on third-party services. He looked for a personal server OS with a GUI that could do this and found nothing. The idea of Umbrel and providing non-technical people a personal server was born. 

“The personal computer revolution shifted computing from rooms full of computers (mainframes) owned by corporations to personal computers owned by regular people in their homes. The personal server revolution is shifting computing from rooms full of servers (data centers) owned by corporations to personal servers owned by regular people in their homes.” - Mayank Chhabra

Umbel was self-funded until recently. The company has now raised $3M in a seed round.


## Business Activities

While the company was founded to provide a way to participate in the Bitcoin network at a protocol level vs the application layer, bypassing all intermediaries, it has evolved into a personal server for those desiring privacy from what the founders call “surveillance capitalism”.

Umbrel’s intended customers are people desiring complete control and privacy over their digital lives. As of October 2021, 13,000 people are running personal servers in their homes using Umbrel. The company believes this is just the beginning. 

The solution Umbrel offers is privacy. Cloud services that store data can misconfigure, they can be breached, they lack visibility, they may share data externally, and there can be malicious insiders and cyberattacks. While cloud storage may be the most secure and cost effective measure for businesses, it may be worth a small expense and effort to keep personal data in your own home for those that desire it. 

I could not find any direct competitors with Umbrel, and although directions to set up a personal web server with a Raspberry Pi can be found online, it is not an OS. The intended audience for Umbrel is not someone with the technical ability to do this, rather, Umbrel wants to provide more of a “plug and play” customer experience.

Umbrel is a Linux distribution. It has a package manager, but unlike most, the packages are docker containers. Technically, it is a management tool for Docker containers. Umbrel is available for free and their source code is on GitHub. 


## Landscape

Umbrel remains in the cryptocurrency domain, allowing users to connect to Bitcoin Node, Lightning Node and BTCPay networks without a third party. It has also evolved into a personal server OS for self-hosting everything. 

As the digital world accelerates and the stability of fiat currencies are questioned, censorship and digital privacy concerns continue to grow. What this company desires to provide is access to the internet without a third-party service.

By searching the internet, I’ve found ways to build a personal web server using a Raspberry Pi, but I’ve not found any competitors providing non-technical people a way to easily run their personal servers.


## Results

Umbrel is just in its infancy. They have achieved thousands of users and a good reputation among Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin enthusiasts on social media. The OS is a new endeavor. They are just beginning to hire beyond the founders. 


## Recommendations

I realize the concept behind Umbrel is new and they are working out the kinks, but I’m excited for them to market this idea to the masses. 

If Bitcoin sees more mass adoption, I would think that would be the best way to get people interested in the project. Every bull run, more people start running their own nodes to support the network. Mass adoption would require people with little technical expertise to be able to do this. 

Marketing “privacy” is an interesting topic. It almost seems taboo, like you must be doing something wrong if you want to hide it. Pictures, like Bitcoin, seem like a fairly politically neutral way to approach people seeking privacy. Umbrel does market this near the top of their website, along with Nextcloud (Google Drive replacement) for people wishing to keep their documents, contacts, etc. out of corporate servers. 

If I were to offer a recommendation, I would also market disaster-proof back-up machines, like a Time Machine, if information will no longer be stored on a Cloud.

I’m not sure how the company plans to make money in the future, but selling hardware like The Bitcoin Machine, and back up systems, could be profitable.
